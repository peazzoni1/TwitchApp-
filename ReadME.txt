This is an app based off of a Free Code Camp development Project.

The app uses TwitchTv’s api to create a custom channel list that includes the user’s logo, display name and name of game or stream. It also has a search field to filter by display name. 

The app was built using Angular to make the api call, populate the table, create the search field and tab functionality.
